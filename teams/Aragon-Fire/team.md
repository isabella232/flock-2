# Aragon Flock proposal: Aragon One 

_This is the basic structure you should follow when creating your team.md where you briefly describe of the current team with links to their relevant social media channels (github, twitter, etc) and provide info of future openings if you plan to hire more people during the year.

## Summary

Aragon Fire is a Porofire.io spinoff team which will be completely dedicated to work on the Aragon project. The team has been working since September 2018 on the AragonDAO Payroll application, The team intends to continue the work on this application and many other initiatives.

To cover our operation costs and continue contributing to the thriving Aragon ecosystem, Aragon Fire requests:

- $1 million paid in DAI (or other stable assets) for 2019, for operational costs.
- ??? ANT vested over the next 2 years, for the long-term incentivization of the current team and future employees.


## Deliverables
TBD


## Grant size

### Estimated operating costs for 2019 
TBD

### ANT package

We would like to request ??? ANT, with 6-month cliff and 2-year vesting.

This ANT package will be primarily used to incentivize employees, by giving them ANT packages as well. Our current commitments with the team are around ???k ANT, which would represent around ??% of the ???ANT we request.

We think this ANT grant will enable us to double our team while maintaining sustainable ANT packages for new employees, and possibly leaving a pool aside for future unexpected use.

We are committed to the Aragon Network in the long-term and therefore want a 2-year vesting schedule.


## Aragon Fire Team
The team is a combination of remote and in-house members distributed across the world, primarily in Europe and America. We have two offices in Argentina (Buenos Aires and Santa Fe) and one office in Belarus (Minsk). Some of the members use these offices as a common location to work and others to meet and work on-site from time to time. We will also hold quarterly offsites to gather together.
